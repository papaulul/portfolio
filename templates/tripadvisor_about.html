        Do you have plans to visit the great city of Atlanta? Are you a frequent traveler that like to use various review websites such as TripAdvisor, Yelp, or Google? If you answered yes to the questions above, I have just the solution for you. By giving me your preferences for an ideal hotel and a great review that you've written before, I'll be able to produce some recommendations! 
        <br>
        <br>
        This is an end to end project, meaning I scraped the data, created the model, and deployed a demo. Look into my Analysis to see how I was able to do it! And check out my demo to see what hotels I would recommend to you!
