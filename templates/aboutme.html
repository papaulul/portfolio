        Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Paul Kim, I'm an aspiring Data Scientist, and I love learning! I
        am currently on my way to get my Master of Science in Analytics at Georgia State University, graduating in
        December 2019. From this program, I was able to expose myself to many different projects, subjects, and fellow
        peers. I use Python as my primary programming, but I do have experience working with R, SAS, Scala, SQL, and
        more! I thoroughly enjoy learning new tools and always open to learning.

        below. Also, feel free to connect with me at LinkedIn as well! Thank you for looking through my site!
