                            <a href="https://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a>
                            is an open-source python package for scraping website data. The dataset for listings
                            information was provided by <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">Inside
                                Airbnb</a>. For the goal of this project, we need a column that will differentiate
                            listings that are part of the "plus" program. Unfortunately, that data is not provided
                            therefore there is a need for scraping this information.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <h4 style="margin-left: 3.25%;">
                            Method 1:
                        </h4>
                        <p style="margin-left: 3.25%;">

                            Luckily, in the dataset, one of the columns contain the url where the information was
                            orginally obtained. Using that, I was able to construct a spider that can visit each +90,000
                            listings. The URL are formatted such that it is: airbnb.com/rooms/XXX where XXX is a number.
                            To determine whether the listing is a Plus listing, we can compare how listing pages look.
                        </p>
                        <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='airbnb_ss1.png') }}" alt="airbnb"
                            class="img-rounded center-block" style="width:75%;">
                        <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='airbnb_ss2.png') }}" alt="airbnb"
                            class="img-rounded center-block" style="width:75%;">
                        <br>
                        <p style="margin-left: 3.25%;">
                            At the bottom, we see that the Plus listing has a badge (and overall looks nicer than the
                            regular listing). We can use this fact to easily differentiate listings. By searching for
                            whether the page contains that badge, we will be able to solve this problem. Although, this
                            is a simple check for a spider to crawl, Airbnb limits the number of request you can make
                            every minute. With over 90,000 listings just for Los Angeles, a crawl will take around 18
                            hours. However, I will be able to find all listings that are plus in my dataset.
                        </p>
                        <h4 style="margin-left: 3.25%;">
                            Method 2:
                        </h4>
                        <p style="margin-left: 3.25%;">
                            Instead of going through 90,000+ different listing, another way is to scrape the url of 
                            Plus listings specifically. Below, we see that Airbnb does segment this population for us: 
                        </p>
                        <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='airbnb_ss3.png') }}" alt="airbnb"
                        class="img-rounded center-block" style="width:75%;">
                        <br>
                        <p style="margin-left: 3.25%;">
                            However, when we look at the page, it only shows 300+ different listings. After running a 
                            spider to crawl through the pages multiple times, it seems that some listings randomly 
                            filter in and out based on Airbnb's searching algorithm. This spider only takes about 20 
                            minutes to run, and the results vary with those with the one in the dataset. By doing this 
                            way, we lose the key to join the dataset and Plus listings (url) as well. 
                        </p>
                        <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='airbnb_ss4.png') }}" alt="airbnb"
                        class="img-rounded center-block" style="width:75%;">
                        <br>
                        <p style="margin-left: 3.25%;">
                            Even with the benefits of speed, the miss rate was too much for this method. Therefore 
                            Method 1 was chosen in scraping the Plus listings. 
                        </p>

                        We will be working with 2 different datatsets. However one will contain hotel
                        information, and the other will contain all of the review information. In the end we will merge
                        both of these tables to make sure we're working with the correct data. However, there are some
                        hotels that do not have reviews. For our model(s) to give the best recommendations, we will not
                        be working with these hotels. This decreases our hotel count from 223 to 150 to look at.

                                We definitely see that the number of reviews is right skewed. This is backed up by our
                                descriptive statistics with our mean being much bigger than our median. We can try to
                                fix this distribution later in some transformations later on.

                                Since I was able to scrape almost every review, I could see if the stars provided by
                                TripAdvisor are actually accurate to what reviewers are saying.

                                For the most part, we see that it follows a linear path. Which is fine, it was an
                                assumption that they would round to the nearest half value.

                                One thing I want to see was whether just the sheer number of amenities would have a
                                relationship with the Hotel rating.

                                We see from the violin chart, that it does seem to increase slightly, but then on the 5
                                stars have a lower amount. We also see that some of the distributions are skewed amongst
                                the stars, which we will need to look out for.

                                Finally, we'll look at high and low price according to the hotel rating. The general
                                thought would be, the better the hotel, the more expensive it would be.

                        I decided to utilize Microsoft's Azure cloud services to perform most of the heavy lifting in my
                        modeling. My approach to find the best hotel for the user is to:
                        <li style="margin-left: 5%;">Cluster by hotel information</li>
                        <li style="margin-left: 5%;">Cluster by reviews</li>
                        <li style="margin-left: 5%;">Match user's preferences to Hotel and Reviews</li>
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 3.25%;">
                        A factor I decided to keep out of the models was price of the hotel rooms. This is becasue I
                        wanted the user to have a choice between hotels that are similar in everything but price.
                        Therefore they can choose the hotel based on their budget.

                    <h3 style="font-size: 25px ; margin-left:2%;">Hotel Cluster:</h3>
                    <p style="margin-left: 3.25%;">
                        Since the hotel data set is already small (150 hotels), I was hoping that we might be able to
                        find a good separation between clusters. There are some numerical values within the information
                        scraped, so we needed to scale everything to the same range. K-Means is an unsupervised machine
                        learning model. Although we can pick any number of clusters for our model, I used the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering)">
                            elbow method</a> to determine the optimal amount. We need to calculate the inertia or
                        within-cluster sum-of-squares criterion of each point, which is just the sum of squares of each
                        point minus the closest cluster. These calculations will let us know how close each point are to
                        their cluster. The higher the inertia it is, the worse the model is considered. However, it is
                        known that we can always get the inertia lower by adding more centers, and to completely
                        minimize inertia, we could just pick the number of centers to equal the number of rows. This
                        would defeat the whole point of trying to cluster the points together. Instead, by looking at
                        the elbow, or the point where the model suddenly decreases its rate of approaching that perfect
                        inertia, we can pick that as our "best" number of centers.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 3.25%;">
                        Although theoretically, the elbow method is a great way of choosing the centers, it does not
                        always come up clean. As we see above, it just looks like the curve just keeps decreasing. I
                        didn't want to choose a number too high, so I decided 30 would be our center based on how the
                        rate changed.

                        <br>

                        After picking the number of centers, I modeled again over the data as our final model using 30
                        as our centers. I then saved that model to be used later in the <a
                            href="/tripadvisor/demo">demo</a>.
                        Then I created a column as cluster where each row is assigned to a cluster 0-29.

                        The overall goal of clustering the reviews is to find reviews that would closely match those of
                        the user. This would be useful if the user has written a review of a hotel where they had a
                        great time and now they can find users who had similar experiences at different hotels.
                        <br><br>
                        I followed a methodology close to the Hotel Cluster to achieve our goal. However, since I'm
                        now dealing with words and not model we cannot just model that. Instead we need to convert these
                        words into some numeric values. I employed using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
                        (Tf-IDF). Tf-IDF is a statistical tool that allows to learn the importance of a word is to a
                        document in the corpus. Essentially, by looking at the frequency in the word vs the inverse of
                        the frequency of the type of document from the population of all of our reviews. Therefore to
                        think about this, every review I scraped would be the corpus, each review would be the document,
                        and words in said review would be the words. This method would allow us to rank the words based
                        on prevalance within the documents. Thus changing our words into meaningful numbers that we can
                        use to cluster.
                        <br><br>
                        Now we look for our elbow curve once again.

                    <p style="margin-left: 3.25%;">
                        We can see that the elbow is much more clearer than our previous one. It is at around 200, so
                        we will proceed with that number. We again save the model, and run it on each review. We assign
                        them to a cluster from 0 to 199 write it on the table.
